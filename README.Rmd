# A General Framework for Quality Control Metrics

```{r env, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("BiocStyle"))
```

## About 

The `qcmetrics` package provides a general framework to develope
quality control (QC) pipelines for any type of data that can be
imported into `R`. The application of `qcmetrics` can be schematised
in 5 points

1. Identify a set of quality metrics of interest and implement them
   and their visualisation method into individual `QcMetric`
   instances.
2. Bundles the `QcMetric` items into a `QcMetrics` instance. 
3. Automatically generate reports in pdf of html using the `qcReport`
   function using the `QcMetrics` object of step 2 as input.
4. Optionally, reports can be customised. 
5. Wrap the above steps into a wrapper function or a new QC package
   for production use.

QC pipelines and packages will be described and disseminated through
the [wiki](https://github.com/lgatto/qcmetrics/wiki).
